## TO DO LIST
- Music board sort of a thingy?
- Make a front page which shows 5 buttons - Spells List, Dice Rolling, Character Sheet, music board and NPC randomizer
- char sheet will be grayed out for now
- Since Pinned state is enabled, either add redux and create state store, or cookies, or a store that remembers the pinned elements (maybe the query idea, maybe a custom ID that referes to specific combination)


## TO DO - DONE
- INTEGRATE SASS - PRIORITY
- Pinned state
- Allow an on/off functionality for each of the buttons, so that you can select a few levels and display those -
