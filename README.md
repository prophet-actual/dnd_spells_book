# D&D 5e Companion

## TO DO LIST
- INTEGRATE SASS - PRIORITY NEXT
- Since Pinned state is enabled, either add redux and create state store, or cookies, or a store that remembers the pinned elements (maybe the query idea, maybe a custom ID that referes to specific combination)
- Make a front page which shows 3 buttons - Spells List, Dice Rolling and Character Sheet? CONCEPT LEVEL STILL

## TO DO - DONE
- Pinned state
- Allow an on/off functionality for each of the buttons, so that you can select a few levels and display those -
