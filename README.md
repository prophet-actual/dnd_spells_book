# D&D 5e Companion

## TO DO LIST
- Add a Pin for each of the spells, if selected, it adds a query to the URL, moves the pinned spell away from the listing, and is easily accessible. Also, maybe a quick copy button if URL contains a ?spells=1,4,5 etc
- Make a front page which shows 3 buttons - Spells List, Dice Rolling and Character Sheet? CONCEPT LEVEL STILL

## TO DO - DONE
- Allow an on/off functionality for each of the buttons, so that you can select a few levels and display those -
